Note: A BST is a binary tree where nodes are ordered in the following way:

each node contains one key (also known as data)

The keys in the left subtree are less than the key in its parent node, in short L < P;

The keys in the right subtree are greater the key in its parent node, in short P < R;

Duplicate keys are not allowed.



Following the above criteria, draw a BST for the following keys (you receive keys from

left to right) and answer the below questions.

11, 6, 8, 19, 4, 17, 43, 49, 31

What will be the child nodes for element 6 ?

ANS:4 8

How many leaf nodes in the resultant tree ?

ANS:5 leaf nodes.They are 4,8,17,31,49

How many compares (key compares) does it take to insert the last element(31) in to the tree?

ANS:3 comparisions

How many compares (key compares) does it take when we call get(8) method ?

ANS:2 key comparisions
