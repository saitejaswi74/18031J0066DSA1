Give the sequence of subarray sizes in the merges performed by both the top-down and the bottom-up merge sort algorithms, for N = 39.

ANS:

N=39
Top-down approach:

2 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 10 2 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 10 20 2 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 10 2 3 2 5 2 2 4 9 19 39

Bottom-up approach:

2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 8 8 8 8 15 16 23 39
