Fill in the blanks-3

In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N keys, the number of compares (equality tests) for search and insert is proportional to N/M. (true/false)

ANS:true

Any good hash function should have the three properties :  (true/false)

It should be deterministic, equal keys must produce the same hash value.

It should be efficient to compute.

It should uniformly distribute the keys.

ANS:true

ANS:4 empty lists
