Suppose that the sequence P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E 
(where a letter means insert and an asterisk means remove the maximum) is applied to an initially 
empty priority queue. Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations.

ANS:

Insert: P R I O
After heapifying sequence is R P I O
Remove: R
Sequence after removing is P I O

Insert:R 
After heapifying sequence is R P O I
Remove: R

Sequence after removing is P O I
Remove: P

Sequence after removing O I
Insert: I
After heapifying sequence is O I I
Remove: O

Sequence after removing I I
Insert: T
After heapifying sequence is T I I
Remove: T

Sequence after removing I I
Insert:Y
After heapifying sequence is Y I I
Remove:Y

Sequence after removing I I
Remove:I
After heapifying sequence is  I

Sequence after removing I
Remove:I
No elements

Insert:Q U E
After heapifying sequence is U Q E
Remove: U

Sequence after removing Q E
Remove: Q

Sequence after removing E
Remove: E

No elements
Insert: U
Remove: U

Insert: E

After removing maximum operations R R P O T Y I I U Q E U

E is on the left
